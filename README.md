## ‚ú® Features

- **üåç Cross-Platform**: Supports RPM and DEB-based Linux distributions
- **‚ö° Smart Downloads**: Resume interrupted downloads, skip unnecessary updates
- **üõ°Ô∏è Resource Management**: Comprehensive cleanup with lock file protection
- **üîí Security**: Ownership verification, safe path validation
- **üìä Configurable**: Environment variable configuration for all settings
- **üîç Debug Support**: Detailed logging and troubleshooting capabilities
- **üéØ Production Ready**: Follows industry best practices and cleanup standards

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Download and run
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swipswaps/vscode-insiders-updater/main/vscode-insiders-updater.sh | bash

# Or clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/swipswaps/vscode-insiders-updater.git
cd vscode-insiders-updater
./vscode-insiders-updater.sh
```

## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux (RPM or DEB-based distribution)
- Bash 4.0+
- Internet connection

### Required Commands
- `curl` or `wget` - For downloading
- `rpm`/`dpkg` - Package management
- `dnf`/`yum`/`apt`/`zypper` - Package managers
- `sudo` - For package installation

### Supported Distributions

| Distribution | Package Manager | Status |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Fedora** | `dnf` | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |
| **RHEL/CentOS** | `yum` | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |
| **openSUSE** | `zypper` | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |
| **Ubuntu** | `apt` | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |
| **Debian** | `apt` | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |
| **Linux Mint** | `apt` | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All settings can be customized via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VSCODE_BACKUP_SCRIPT` | *(auto-detect)* | Path to backup script |
| `VSCODE_DOWNLOAD_DIR` | `~/.cache/vscode-insiders-updates` | Download cache directory |
| `PARTIAL_DOWNLOAD_THRESHOLD` | `1048576` (1MB) | Size threshold for partial download cleanup |
| `PROCESS_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `5` | Seconds to wait for graceful process shutdown |
| `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` | `1800` (30min) | Download timeout in seconds |
| `DOWNLOAD_RETRIES` | `3` | Number of download retry attempts |
| `DEBUG` | `0` | Enable debug logging (set to `1`) |
| `SKIP_COMPLIANCE_CHECK` | `0` | Skip cleanup compliance validation |

### Configuration Examples

```bash
# Use custom backup script
VSCODE_BACKUP_SCRIPT="/path/to/backup.sh" ./vscode-insiders-updater.sh

# Use different download directory
VSCODE_DOWNLOAD_DIR="/tmp/vscode-downloads" ./vscode-insiders-updater.sh

# Debug mode with faster timeouts
DEBUG=1 DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=300 ./vscode-insiders-updater.sh

# Production settings with extended timeouts
DOWNLOAD_RETRIES=5 PROCESS_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=10 ./vscode-insiders-updater.sh
```

## üîß How It Works

1. **System Detection**: Automatically detects your Linux distribution and package manager
2. **Lock Management**: Prevents concurrent executions with atomic lock files
3. **Resource Protection**: Launches external terminal if run from within VSCode
4. **Process Verification**: Ensures VSCode Insiders is closed before updating
5. **Smart Downloads**: Checks for existing downloads and resumes if interrupted
6. **Package Installation**: Uses appropriate package manager for your system
7. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removes all temporary resources on exit

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Ownership Verification**: Validates file ownership before deletion
- **Path Validation**: Ensures temporary directories are in safe locations
- **Process Isolation**: Prevents interference with running VSCode instances
- **Atomic Operations**: Lock files prevent race conditions
- **Signal Handling**: Proper cleanup on script interruption (SIGINT, SIGTERM)

## üìä Smart Download Management

- **Resume Capability**: Interrupted downloads resume from last byte
- **Version Detection**: Skips downloads if file is already current
- **Integrity Verification**: Validates downloaded packages before installation
- **Cache Management**: Persistent download cache between runs
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Avoids re-downloading identical files

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Mode
```bash
DEBUG=1 ./vscode-insiders-updater.sh
```

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied**
```bash
chmod +x vscode-insiders-updater.sh
```

**Lock File Issues**
```bash
# Remove stale lock file
rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/vscode_insiders_updater.lock"
```

**Download Issues**
```bash
# Clear download cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/vscode-insiders-updates/
```

**Package Manager Issues**
```bash
# Update package manager cache
sudo dnf makecache  # Fedora
sudo apt update     # Ubuntu/Debian
```

## üß™ Testing

The script includes built-in compliance validation:

```bash
# Run with compliance checking (default)
./vscode-insiders-updater.sh

# Skip compliance validation
SKIP_COMPLIANCE_CHECK=1 ./vscode-insiders-updater.sh

# Test syntax only
bash -n vscode-insiders-updater.sh
```
